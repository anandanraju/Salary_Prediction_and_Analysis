# Salary_Prediction_and_Analysis

* K-nearest neighbors (KNN) is a type of supervised learning algorithm used for both regression and classification. 
* KNN tries to predict the correct class for the test data by calculating the distance between the test data and all the training points. 
* Then select the K number of points which is closet to the test data.
